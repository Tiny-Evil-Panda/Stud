<p>	The Holy Roman Empire (Latin: Sacrum Romanum Imperium) was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in 
central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The 
largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the 
Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories.</p>

<p>	On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor, reviving the title in 
Western Europe after more than three centuries. The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and 
from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death 
of the last Italian claimant, Berengar, in 924. The title was revived in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor, 
fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for 
over eight centuries. Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire, while 
others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning.Scholars generally concur,however, in relating an 
evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire, describing a gradual assumption of the 
imperial title and role.</p>

<p>	The precise term "Holy Roman Empire" was not used until the 13th century, but the concept of translatio 
imperii, the notion that he held supreme power inherited from the emperors of Rome, was fundamental to the 
prestige of the emperor. The office of Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally elective, although frequently 
controlled by dynasties. The German prince-electors, the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire, usually elected 
one of their peers as "King of the Romans", and he would later be crowned emperor by the Pope; the tradition of 
papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century. The empire never achieved the extent of political 
unification formed in France, evolving instead into a decentralized, limited elective monarchy composed of 
hundreds of sub-units, principalities, duchies, counties, Free Imperial Cities, and other domains. The power of 
the emperor was limited, and while the various princes, lords, bishops and cities of the empire were vassals who 
owed the emperor their allegiance, they also possessed an extent of privileges that gave them de facto 
independence within their territories. Emperor Francis II dissolved the empire on 6 August 1806, after the 
creation of the Confederation of the Rhine by Napoleon.</p>
